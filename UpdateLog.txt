Defined a simpe frame of game
Defined a abstract class for vehicle and lane
Builded a start page

In main.py line 114, there is a function which is important to know as it ralated control the movement of object.

    # set the simulation FPS as 60
    # this function will return the time interval between this frame and previous frame in ms
    # it should be 16.67 ms (60 frame per second) if not lag
    time_delta = clock.tick(60)

The movement of object should take the time interval into account, rather than based on frame.
Well it could based on frame, but it will cause confusion when FPS is not stable, like the speed of car and the frequency of change of traffic light is slower when FPS lower.

By the way my python version is 3.9, the content so far should support the lower version of python, but I think it is better for everyone to unify the version.
